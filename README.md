# File-Sorter-Desktop-App

# Description: 

- This desktop app uses electron and a React UI to sort files and directories in a folder chosen by the user! The app gives you the option to make new dirctories, name them, and then specify the types of files you'd like for those directories to store.

# Running The App: 
- If you'd like to install the app, it's as easy as downloading all the files in the repo
- Since the app uses node.js for the backend, type ```npm run build``` in your command line interface
- Then, type ``` npm run start``` to open the desktop app
